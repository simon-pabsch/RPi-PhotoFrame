# 1. Project description
This project develops a RPi-based solution to show your favourite photos on a digital photo frame to your family, friends, coworkers and customers in a gently way.

You can access the photos on the RPi locally or you can integrate your photo server and synchronize your photos remotely via ssh. This project offers a solution to provide both options.

This project also provides a mobile app integration that the photo frame can be controlled by your smartphone.
